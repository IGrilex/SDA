# Data structures laboratory

## Topic 1: Linked lists, Queues, Stacks

In this topic i have acquired knowledge working with linked lists accessed using application-specific interfaces: Queues (FIFO), Stacks (LIFO)

## Topic 2: Graphs

Working with graphs has been an opportunity learn how to approach real-world cost optimisation problems using shortest-path solutions and minimum spanning trees (especially in case of distribution/reach challenge)
I have learned how to apply Bellman-Ford, Dijkstra and Prim algorithms and their usefulness in dealing with real-world computing data.
